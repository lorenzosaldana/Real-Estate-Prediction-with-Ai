# Predicting Real Estate Prices with Ai
## Description
By using a public dataset provided by the Real Estate Information Library Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism of Japan, this project aims to predict real estate prices using Ai techniques.
The models used in this project are : XGBoost, Random Forest, ElasticNet, and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN). These were chosen as they are the commonly used models in other real estate price prediction projects.
RNNs were included here to see how deep learning compares to machine learning for real estate prices.
